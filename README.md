Local Weather App Project
This project is part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum, which helps you to learn how to code through online courses, projects and also provides interview preparation.

Project Guidelines
The aim for this project was to build a web app that shows the user their local weather. FreeCodeCamp allowed us to use whichever libraries or APIs that we required to solve this challenge. The design and UI was up to us to create.
To complete the project, the below user stories needed to be fulfilled:

I can see the weather in my current location
There is a weather icon, or background image, showing what the weather is like in more detail (Example: sunny, snowy, rain ..etc)


Made with
HTML, CSS, JavaScript & JQuery
Introducing myself to APIs and how they work with injecting into basic websites.
